              <p class="primer_parrafo">Since I was a kid I was always trying to know how things worked.
                Cooking always has been like an experiment, magic alchemy, Meal times were the best time of the day, family gathering around the food planning what to eat next, cooking together.

            That way of thinking led me to study Biology in the Universidad Complutense de Madrid but then I had the oportunity to step into a great kitchen to see how it worked and I felt in love with it. 
            The daily work, crafting the ingredients into delicious and beautiful dishes and the reward you feel when your guests enjoy their meals was addictive.
            I signed up in the best culinary school I could find, Escuela Luis Irizar in Donosti (San Sebastian) where I had the opportunity to intern in some of the best restaurants in the world such as Arzak (***)
